/**
 * Tests that cross-module top-level function discovery works for compile-time safety.
 *
 * The @Singleton function provideFeatureConfig() in sample-feature-module's "featureutil" package
 * generates a function hint that makes FeatureConfig visible during compile-time validation.
 * CrossModuleFunctionModule scans "featureutil" and "examples.crossmodule", so the safety
 * check sees FeatureConfig as provided and CrossModuleConsumer's dependency is satisfied.
 *
 * This test just verifies the compilation succeeded — the compile-time safety check
 * ran during compilation and would have caused a build error if FeatureConfig was not discoverable.

        // 3. BindingRegistry validated CrossModuleConsumer's dependency on FeatureConfig as satisfied
